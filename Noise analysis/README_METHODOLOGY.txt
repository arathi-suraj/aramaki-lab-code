My idea is to first change the first 
stage amplitude, ie, the input side from the function generator. 

Then, I'm going to go back to the initial waveform height by adjusting the gain on the shaper to restore the peak height to ~970 mV.

This can tell me if the noise is happening before or after the shaper. If the noise is after the shaper, both should show good SNR.
If the noise is before the shaper but after the input stage, then I should see a better SNR when I increase the function generator amplitude.

It's possible that both show similar SNRs if noise is picked up at the input stage/from the function generator. But that should be isolated to the power line/weird clock circuit in the function generator right?
